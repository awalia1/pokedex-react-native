# Pokedex React Native App

A Pokedex React Native mobile app leveraging the Pokemon API using Expo and react-query.
First time ever coding in React Native so may not have adhered to the best practices but found a lot of useful tutorials and github repos that really helped me.

Will probably (and probably should have) create a backend and give users the ability to save their pokemon.

To run project locally (only tested on iOS):

1. clone repo.
2. Install dependencies with 'npx expo install'.
3. Download Expo Go app on your phone from the app store.
4. Run 'npx expo start' in your terminal.
5. Scan the QR code that shows up with your camera.
